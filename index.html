              <p>Abyss reviews is a site where anyone can post reviews about beloved or
              not so beloved games that you have played. From puzzle games like Professor
              Layton to shooters like Call of Duty, we want you share your experiences of
              games you have enjoyed or hated. Feel free to share all.</p>

              <p class="paddingSmallBottom">We not only allow people to post their experiences but we also allow them to
              see how others have experienced a game. Allowing them to get the perspective
              of your every day gamer rather than the opinion of an out of touch video game
              reviewer being paid to give a positive review by companies to big up their
              games.</p>

                based upon the game you search.</p>

         <h2 id="rules" class="paddingSmallTop">Review Rules</h2>
         <ol class="paddingSmallBottom">
           <li>No trash talking others reviews - Everyone is entitled to an opinion,
           please respect it.</li>

           <li>No abusive language - This includes swearing, using slurs (racial, homophobic,
           transphobic, etc).</li>

           <li>No slandering of any organisation or person - If there's a particular reason
           you dislike a company, keep it to yourself. People want to know what a game is like
           not how bad or exploitative a video game creation company is.</li>

           <li>No advertisement - This is a site to post reviews, nobody is here to look
           for miracle hair regrowth or anything else. Reviews about games only please.</li>

           <li>English Only - This is an English site so please keep the website accessible
           to all users.</li>

           <li>Keep discussions PG13 - Whilst some games may contain mature content,
           please keep reviews PG13. There may be young people who want to look at
           the site so no review should contain anything sexually explicit.</li>

           <li>Be constructive but honest - Whilst we want reviews to be considerate
           towards others, we also want honest reviews. After all, people are here to
           get a game based on its positives and negatives.</li>

           <li>No links in your review - Whilst some people may want to post links to backup
           their review points, we don't want any links posted here. This is mainly to avoid
           people being at risk of going to dodgy sites and to reduce chance of rule 4 being
           broken.</li>
