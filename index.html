    <h2>About this site</h2>
    <p>Abyss reviews is a site where anyone can post reviews about beloved or
    not so beloved games that you have played. From puzzle games like Professor
    Layton to shooters like Call of Duty, we want you share your experiences of
    games you have enjoyed or hated. Feel free to share all.</p>
	
    <p>We not only allow people to post their experiences but we also allow them to
    see how others have experienced a game. Allowing them to get the perspective
    of your every day gamer rather than the opinion of an out of touch video game
    reviewer being paid to give a positive review by companies to big up their
    games.</p>
	
    <h2>Review Rules</h2>
	
    <p>To ensure that people can safely enjoy their time going through and creating
    reviews, we have created a set of community guidelines for everyone to follow: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>No trash talking others reviews - Everyone is entitled to an opinion,
      please respect it.</li>
	  
      <li>No abusive language - This includes swearing, using slurs (racial, homophobic,
      transphobic, etc).</li>
	  
      <li>No slandering of any organisation or person - If there's a particular reason
      you dislike a company, keep it to yourself. People want to know what a game is like
      not how bad or exploitative a video game creation company is.</li>
	  
      <li>No advertisement - This is a site to post reviews, nobody is here to look
      for miracle hair regrowth or anything else. Reviews about games only please.</li>
	  
      <li>English Only - This is an English site so please keep the website accessible
      to all users.</li>
	  
      <li>Keep discussions PG13 - Whilst some games may contain mature content,
      please keep reviews PG13. There may be young people who want to look at
      the site so no review should contain anything sexually explicit.</li>
	  
      <li>Be constructive but honest - Whilst we want reviews to be considerate
      towards others, we also want honest reviews. After all, people are here to
      get a game based on its positives and negatives.</li>
	  
      <li>No links in your review - Whilst some people may want to post links to backup
      their review points, we don't want any links posted here. This is mainly to avoid
      people being at risk of going to dodgy sites and to reduce chance of rule 4 being
      broken.</li>
    </ol>
